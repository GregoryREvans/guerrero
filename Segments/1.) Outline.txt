quarter = 108 in Section_D?

Invocation: quarter = 60, 1/4 tone scale that doesn't reach octave, shepard tone orchestration
    dynamic profile: crescendi that are occasionally sudden
    notes: double check scales on final render

Section_A: multiphonics and noodling gestures along with long tones from chord
    dynamic profile: intermittently loud and soft with a few crescendi / diminuendi
    notes: maybe try including other pitches in sopranino and contrabass / consider shifting some attacks by an eighth note

Section_B: quarter = 90, 1/4 tone random-walk glissandi
    dynamic profile: *reconsider* chaotic, uncoordinated swells
    notes: reconsider crescendo points

Section_C: random-walks continue, multiphonics return, tone color shifts with airy tone and occasional tongue slaps
    dynamic profile: medium, getting quieter (random walks = loud, fast chords = moderate, slow chords = quiet)
    notes: maybe try including other pitches in sopranino and contrabass / reconsider articulations

Section_D: quarter = 108? tone color changes to be more airy, emphasize tongue slaps
    dynamic profile: quiet, not yet a whisper
    notes:

Section_E: quarter = 90, repeated notes and tremolo-trills underscored by long tones (*no* multiphonics)
    dynamic profile: suddenly loud again for repetitions but still subdued for long tones
